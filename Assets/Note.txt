Robogame.

Requirements:
All four animations for the robot.
Use one shader.
- Diffuse Shader with an outline.
- Outline can be colored.
- Make custom inspector for the shader.
Include a full game loop.


Game concept: endless runner.

Will automatically walk right.  Can jump, stop, or punch.

Need to update the animator each frame or so.


Task List:

Have robo move relative to the frame of the screen.
- Walks in place when there's no movement.
- Stands still and moves backwards when there's left input.
- Increases walk speed when there's forward input.


Problem: How to ensure that robo's animation matches the speed of the game.

Case 1: 0 scroll speed, zero input.  Return one.

Negative -1 input always equals 0
Zero input always equals the value.
Positive input always equals twice the value.

Edge case: zero scroll speed.

Adjust the animation until it's precisely one meter per second.

Create "Force scroll" component.
Spawn smashable obstacles.
Spawn deadly obstacles.
Handle robot being crushed.
