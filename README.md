I'm pleased with how the endless runner code is working.  The scrolling background gives the game a lot of visual flair.

Animations were altered from the original versions to speed them up so they work better as part of a platformer.  There's plent of room for grooming.

Due to the scheduling issues I was unable to include the required shader, as I was unfamiliar with shader code and prioritized gameplay instead.

With more time, I would have liked to have made Robo's jump force dependent on how long the button is held, as well as smarter obstacle generation.
